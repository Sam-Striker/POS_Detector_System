# POS_Detector_System


1) you need to clean the Data Set and make sure all the bad data are removed

2) you need to make a descripte analysis on the Dataset provide a concise summary of the  main features of a dataset

3) after comparison of 3 classification algorithms of your choice, using the best of them, develop a Model M, that will different classes Y= {hAVE pcos, Have no PC0S}, where Y appartient {Age (yrs), Weight(Kg), Height(Cm), BMI, Blood Group, Pulse rate(bpm), RR(breaths/min), Hb(g/dl), Cycle(R/I), Cycle lenght(days), Marriage Status(Yrs), Pregnant(Y/N), No. of abortions, I beta-HCG(mIU/mL), II beta-HCG(mIU/mL), FSH(mIU/mL), LH(mIU/mL), FCH/LH, Hip(inch), Waist(inch), Waist:Hip Ration, TSH(mIU/mL), AMH(ng/mL), PRL(ng/mL), Vit D3(ng/mL), PRG(ng/mL), rbs(mg/dl), Weight gain(Y/N),... }

4.Develop a Django base Userr  Interface (UI) and Connect it to the Persiting Model M
